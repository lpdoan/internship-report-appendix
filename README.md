# R codefile example for my internship
A R code file I created to serve as an example of the R shiny codebase I was working on during my analytics internship.
Due to confidentiality reasons, I cannot use real commercial data in this file.
It is also an appendix to my Master's internship report.

The main code shows four imaginary customers on a scatterplot with customer details in the tooltips and runs on R shiny interactivity.
